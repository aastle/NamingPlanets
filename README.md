# Unity 2019 Drag and Drop
Unity 2D 2019.4 LTS code implementing drag and drop of sprites to their targets.
Some components are added in code at runtime.  These components are Audio Source, Box Collider 2D and Rigid Body 2D.
This is done so the developer doesn't have to remember to add them atf design time.
